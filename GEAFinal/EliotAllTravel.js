This trip is described in detail in the 'Recollections of Italy, 1860.' In 1861, it was Eliot and Lewes' main destination, with a focus on library research and going to museums in preparation to write <em>Romola</em>. In her journal, Eliot wondered: \"thirty-four days of precious time spent there: will it all be in vain?\" (<em>Journals </em> 89). In 1869, they stayed twice, for 5 days each, with their friends, the Trollopes. For the first 5-day stay in Florence, Eliot was ill and barely left the Trollopes' Villa Ricorboli. For their second 5-day stay, they revisited many museums, and Eliot went to the new Museo di San Marco on April 24 and 26, seeing the frescoes by Fra Angelico that had been off limits to her as a woman in 1860 and 1861. </p><p><a href=\"http://georgeeliotartworld.com/files/original/a5dc6f4f55f0486b72bccda95e1926d8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://georgeeliotartworld.com/files/original/a5dc6f4f55f0486b72bccda95e1926d8.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%;\" /></a></p>"
